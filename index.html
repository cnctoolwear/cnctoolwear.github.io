        <p class="cnc-description"><span class="cnc-description-heading">Description:</span><br/>CNC stands for Computer Numerical Control milling. This essentially means that the milling machine is moved and monitored by numerical computer control, rather than by hand. CNC milling tools perform a machining process similar to drilling and cutting parts with incredible precision, and therefore leave no room for human error. The process is an increasingly popular industrial solution since it can accommodate detailed sizes and shapes of all kinds of material.</p>
        <p class="cnc-working"><span class="cnc-working-heading">Working: </span><br/>A CNC Milling Machine uses a rotating cylindrical cutter to move along multiple axes, and create slots, holes and details in material to turn it into a vehicle or mechanical part. Most machines operate on three to five axes, creating much more precision and detail. Modern CNC milling machines are assembled as both horizontal and vertical machining centers. Components can be made with materials such as plastics, ceramics, and composite materials, in addition to metals. Technical features include automatic tool changers, tool carousels & magazines, coolant systems, and enclosures to keep machines running smoothly on their own without manual interference.</p>
